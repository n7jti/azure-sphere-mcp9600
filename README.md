This code was originally written for the Azure Sphere based Freezer Monitor: https://github.com/n7jti/Freezer-Monitor-Azure-Sphere.  And nearly all of the code for the MCP9600 was initially provided by Chidozie Ononiwu (https://github.com/chidozieononiwu) as part of the Microsoft Hackathon in the summer of 2019. Much thanks to him and his efforts to bring this library to you.
